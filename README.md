## About Elastik Tenancy

Elastik Tenancy is an architectural approach used in Laravel Jetstream applications to serve multiple tenants (e.g., clients, organizations, or users) from a single codebase while keeping their data isolated. This pattern is useful when you want to create a Software as a Service (SaaS) application where different users or organizations share the same application but require separation of their data and configuration.

## Learning Elastik Tenancy

Elastik Tenancy has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://tenancy.elastik.id/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
