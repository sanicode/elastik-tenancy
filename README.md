## About Elastik Tenancy

Laravel Jetstream is a robust application scaffolding for Laravel, providing essential features such as user authentication, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via Laravel Sanctum, and optional team management. Elastik Tenancy combined with a multitenancy architecture, Laravel Jetstream can be adapted to serve multiple tenants, each with their isolated data and configurations.

## Integrating Multitenancy with Laravel Jetstream

### Tenant Identification:

    -   Subdomains: Each tenant can be identified by a unique subdomain (e.g., tenant1.yourapp.com). Middleware can be used to detect the subdomain and load the appropriate tenant configuration.

    -   Domains: Each tenant can have its domain (e.g., tenant1.com), with the application routing requests to the correct tenant based on the domain.

    -   Query String or Path: Tenants can be identified by a unique identifier in the URL path or query string (e.g., yourapp.com/tenant1).

### User Authentication:

    -   Jetstreamâ€™s user authentication system can be extended to support multitenancy by associating users with a specific tenant. For example, each user could have a tenant_id field in the database, linking them to the appropriate tenant.

    -   Authentication logic can be adjusted to ensure that users can only log in to their respective tenants.

### Database Separation:

    -   Depending on your multitenancy approach, you might use a shared database with a tenant_id column to segregate data or multiple databases where each tenant has its own database.
    -   Laravel's database connections can be dynamically configured based on the tenant, ensuring that the correct database is used for each request.

### Middleware:

    -   Custom middleware can be used to identify the current tenant and configure the application accordingly. This includes setting the database connection, loading tenant-specific configurations, and ensuring that authenticated users belong to the correct tenant.

### Routes and Controllers:

    -   Routes can be grouped based on tenants, allowing for tenant-specific functionality within your application. Controllers can be adapted to ensure they handle data in the context of the current tenant.
